# Volume-Control-With-Hand-Detection

The Volume Control With Hand Detection OpenCV Python was developed using Python OpenCV, In this Python OpenCV Project With Source Code we are going Building a Volume Controller with OpenCV , To change the volume of a computer.

Building a Volume Controller with OpenCV can be accomplished in just 3 simple steps:

<p>Step 1. Detect Hand landmarks</p>
<p>Step 2. Calculate the distance between thumb tip and index finger tip.</p>
<p>Step 3. Map the distance of thumb tip and index finger tip with volume range. For my case, distance between thumb tip and index finger tip was within the range of 15 – 220 and the volume range was from -63.5 – 0.0.</p>
